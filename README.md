## Pre requirements

You need to have `Docker Compose` installed in your machine. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Project Scaffolding

There are 2 main folders, `client`, with the frontend files and `server` with the backend service (api) files

## Run Application

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Eidher/rss-feed
$ cd rss-feed
$ npm start
```

That's it! When it finishes, go to your browser and access the url [http://localhost:2080](http://localhost:2080).

## Run Tests

Inside root folder, run:

```shell
$ npm test
```

## TIPS

If you want to see the lazy loading of the feeds in a slower transition, go to **Developer Tools** (Chrome) and select the option **Slow 3G** in the Network tab.
